NOTE of this branch `private'
=============================
This contains fixes for my personal mutated OCaml compiler. Probably nothing useful for the others.


Requirements
============

* Linux (32-bit or 64-bit)
* OCaml >= 3.11.2

Install
=======

1:  ./configure [options]

Usefull options (examples):
  --bindir=/opt/typerex
  --with-lispdir=~/.emacs.d
      default is a system-wide installation path
  --with-ocp-build=<command>
      default is 'ocp-build' if found, `pwd`/boot/ocp-build.boot otherwise
  --disable-auto-complete
      default is to install Emacs auto-complete, unless found in lispdir
  --enable-cmt
      binary-annotate typerex sources (for typerex developpers)

2:  make
3:  sudo make install

Append (and/or customize) the contents of emacs.append to your ~/.emacs:

4:  cat emacs.append >>~/.emacs

Uninstall
=========

To remove installed binaries and libraries:

- sudo make uninstall

Generating .cmt(i) files for TypeRex sources
============================================

Unless you already compiled TypeRex a first time, here is how to
generate .cmt(i) files for TypeRex itself:

1:  ./configure   (without '--enable-cmt')
2:  make
3:  ./configure --enable-cmt
4:  make
